# API-SERVICE 

Service-Model API Project

"Api service" is a project in which an API is called and different users attributes and blog posts are shown on a web page

* Making use of the https://dummyapi.io/docs API

### Used Technologies

* React
* Material UI
* Axios
* Chakra UI
* Dummy API

### Approaches

* I began studying the challenge, understanding what I needed to learn in order to develop it
* Following by sketching the design on paper. Separating all of the elements required to create the website
* Taking into account the pagination for the organization of the elements in the layout
* I spent a few hours learning how to use the Pagination and the React-Router-Dom components
* I began the coding development, first focusing on functionality and studying how the API works

It must have taken me about  hours to develop it in total, including study and development time



### JS File

* Installed and used the Axios library to data fetching
* Declared different variables, used useState to update the value of the function
* Created a function to ask for data to the Api and return the response
* Used useNavigation react hook to route through  different pages
* Used pagination component to organized the API response
* Installed and used an "app-bar" with a button to view the list of users


## CSS FILE

* Used Materila UI library App-Bar 
* Used SX Prop to customize some of the elements
* Used Media queries to create a responsive design


### Faced difficulties and features to implement in the future

* Some issues with the design's development because I wasn't clear on how I wanted to present the elements, which distracted me from the functionality
* Some technical issues with Git-Hub
